Task Tracker
In this one day sprint I created a task tracking app using vanilla JS, HTML, and Tailwind CSS in which a user can create a to-do list and add tasks with names, descriptions, priorities, statuses, and due dates.

I was having trouble with this modal element I got from flowbite. It kept refreshing the page on me.
